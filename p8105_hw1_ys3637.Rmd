## Problem 1

```{r}
# load data set penguins.
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
# print out the first several lines of the data and we see it has 8 variables:
# species of penguins (factor), island (factor), bill length in mm (double),
# bill depth in mm (double), flipper_length_mm (integer), body_mass_g (integer),
# sex of penguins (factor), year (int).
head(penguins)
# to find the size of the dataset.
# we can tell penguins dataset has 344 rows and 8 cols.
nrow(penguins)
ncol(penguins)
# the mean of flipper length is 200.9 mm
mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Therefore, we can tell in dataset penguins, it has 8 variables: species of penguins (factor), island (factor), bill length in mm (double), bill depth in mm (double), flipper_length_mm (integer), body_mass_g (integer), sex of penguins (factor), year (int). And the size of the dataset is 344 rows and 8 columns, while the mean of flipper length is 200.9 mm, not including NA.
