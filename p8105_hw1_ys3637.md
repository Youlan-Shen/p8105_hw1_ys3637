## Problem 1

``` r
# load data set penguins.
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
# print out the first several lines of the data and we see it has 8 variables:
# species of penguins (factor), island (factor), bill length in mm (double),
# bill depth in mm (double), flipper_length_mm (integer), body_mass_g (integer),
# sex of penguins (factor), year (int).
head(penguins)
```

    ## # … with abbreviated variable names ¹​flipper_length_mm, ²​body_mass_g

``` r
# to find the size of the dataset.
# we can tell penguins dataset has 344 rows and 8 cols.
nrow(penguins)
```

    ## [1] 344

``` r
ncol(penguins)
```

    ## [1] 8

``` r
# the mean of flipper length is 200.9 mm
mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
```

    ## [1] 200.9152

Therefore, we can tell in dataset penguins, it has 8 variables: species
of penguins (factor), island (factor), bill length in mm (double), bill
depth in mm (double), flipper_length_mm (integer), body_mass_g
(integer), sex of penguins (factor), year (int). And the size of the
dataset is 344 rows and 8 columns, while the mean of flipper length is
200.9 mm, not including NA.

``` r
# create a scatterplot of flipper_length_mm (y) vs bill_length_mm (x)
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
```

## Problem 2

``` r
# create a dataframe
df = 
  tibble(
    random_N = rnorm(n = 10),
    logical = random_N > 0,
    char = c("a", "a", "a", "b", "b", "b", "c", "c", "c", "c"),
    fac = factor(char, levels = c("a", "b", "c"))
  )
# print out the dataframe
df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##    random_N logical char  fac  
    ##       <dbl> <lgl>   <chr> <fct>
    ##  1    1.60  TRUE    a     a    
    ##  2    0.356 TRUE    a     a    
    ##  3    0.747 TRUE    a     a    
    ##  4    1.67  TRUE    b     b    
    ##  5    0.355 TRUE    b     b    
    ##  6   -0.185 FALSE   b     b    
    ##  7   -0.918 FALSE   c     c    
    ##  8   -0.324 FALSE   c     c    
    ##  9   -0.676 FALSE   c     c    
    ## 10   -1.62  FALSE   c     c

``` r
# take the mean of each variable in a dataframe
# the mean of random_N is the following
df %>%
  pull(random_N) %>%
  mean()
```

    ## [1] 0.1011921

``` r
# the mean of the logical is the following
df %>%
  pull(logical) %>%
  mean()
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
# the mean of the char is NA, not applicable
df %>%
  pull(char) %>%
  mean()
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(.): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
# the mean of the fac is NA, not applicable
df %>%
  pull(fac) %>%
  mean()
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(.): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

From the above, we can see that both random_N and logical variables have
a mean–mean of random_N is 0.72 and mean of logical is 0.6–but neither
char nor fac has a mean.

``` r
# apply the as.numeric to each of the variable, the output is not shown
as.numeric(df$random_N)
as.numeric(df$logical)
as.numeric(df$char)
as.numeric(df$fac)
```

After we apply as.numeric function to each variable in dataframe, three
of these variables have a numerical result–random_N stays the same,
logical becomes 0 or 1, and factor becomes 1, 2, 3. However, character
does not successfully change to a numerical vector.

I assume that when we take the mean to each of variable, random_N is
numeric, so its mean definitely can be calculated, and logical will be
automatically converted to a numeric vector, and its mean will be
calculated based on the converted numeric vector.

Even though factor can be converted to a numeric vector through
as.numeric function, when we calculate the mean directly on the factor,
it will not automatically convert to numeric type, so the result is NA.

For character, since it cannot be converted to numeric, we cannot
calculate the mean of a character vector, the result is NA.
